                                We believe on the better tomorrow of this world and this defines our business to the main level. We concentrate on the consequences of our business activities and we are concerned about the issues on which we have to converge. We are planning to concentrate on the biodiversity of the environment and we are focusing on creating awareness to topple the gas emissions – while providing the energy solutions that the people need for the better world.

                                  Environmental risks are due to the operations near areas of high biological diversity and high ecological vulnerability. So Bakri Energy is merely focusing on two types of environmental risks, one is oil spills from oil tankers and second is to improve efforts for bio-diversity. This why there is Zero incident at Bakri since its inception. We have a corporate will and we are inclined towards the need for changes to internal management systems for achieving environmental improvements.</p>

                                Bakri Energy has aimed to focus on the renewable energy by trying to get connected to the grid which is powered by renewable energy and plan to concentrate on the renewable energy sources for our retail outlets as well. This will eventually help us to reduce dependability on grid power and diesel generators as well as reducing the overall energy cost.</p>
